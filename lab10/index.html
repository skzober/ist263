        <h2>Personal Info</h2>
        <p>My name is Sophie Zober. I am a sophomore in the iSchool at Syracuse University with a major of Innovation, Society and Technology.I am interested in learning about designing websites, social media and how technology is affecting the world.  Some skills I have are customer experience and influencer marketing from my job I have had back at home at a little boutique by my house. <strong>My favorite</strong> hobbies are to hang out with friends, watch TV and go skiing with my family. I am very excited to continue my journey here at Syracuse with all the amazing people here supporting me. </p>
